## 159.336 — Assignment 3
Due: 24 October 2025

### Summary
This assignment requires you to write an Android app. You may choose any application idea (provided it is not offensive) — something
useful to you, your friends, or family is a good choice. Marks are awarded for interesting, well-written apps that make good use of
the Android platform and play nicely with other apps (for example, releasing resources when not in use).

### Key Requirements and Rules
- Your app must be written specifically for this assignment and must not have been completed for another course or before you
  started 159336. If you incorporate existing code (for example, a game written for 159261), clearly comment which parts were
  written for this assignment.
- Plagiarism is not allowed. If your app is found to be based on code from books, tutorials, or online repositories, you will
  receive 0 marks and it may be reported to the university's academic integrity office.
- You may use external libraries, but list them clearly in your comments. You may not use a complete third-party framework (for
  example, a full game engine).
- Class limit: Individual submissions — maximum 10 Kotlin classes. Group submissions — maximum 20 Kotlin classes. Apps that exceed these limits will receive 0 marks. This rule is intended to discourage copying apps from online sources.
    - The class limit excludes simple data classes (with no methods), theme classes, factory classes, database entities, or
      library classes provided as Gradle dependencies (i.e., not copied into the src directory).
    - If you believe you need more than the allowed classes, email the instructor to request an exemption.

### Platform and Testing
- Your application should run on the Android emulator. The instructor may also test it on a real device.
- If it is difficult to demonstrate the app on the emulator, you may submit a link to a video showing the app running.

### Submission Instructions
- Submit a single zip file generated by Android Studio via File → Export to Zip File... Do not submit an APK. If your zip does
  not build correctly, marks will be deducted. Submissions in any format other than a zip will receive 0 marks.
- For group submissions (up to 3 students): all members must submit the same zip file and include a submission comment listing the
  IDs of the other students in the group. Group submissions should represent proportionally more work and code than an individual
  submission. If you think a group member contributed less work, state this in the submission comment.

### Documentation and Comments
- Use comments in your code as documentation. If you reused code, clearly comment which portions were created specifically for
  this assignment.
- If you use external libraries, note them in comments and ensure they are added as Gradle dependencies (not copied into src).

### Ownership and Marks
- All rights to the app belong to you (or your group). You are free to publish it to the Google Play Store if you wish.
- This assignment is worth 30% of the total marks for the course.## 159.336 — Assignment 3

## Additional Information from Discord

Hi, I have a question about the assignment requirement regarding the 10-class limit.

For data classes, I don’t put any methods inside them, but I do use extension functions (e.g., for domain ↔ data mapping). Since the methods are not defined directly inside the data classes, do these still count toward the 10-class limit?

Also, do UseCase count as part of the 10 classes, or are they considered outside of this restriction (like data classes, entities, or theme classes)?

if I have separate data classes for the domain layer, data layer, and UI layer, and then write mappers for them, how would this be counted? As 0 classes (since they’re simple data classes), as 1 class, or as 3 classes?

To clarify, apart from these cases, the restriction only applies to Kotlin classes, while other files (e.g., composables, extensions, etc.) are not limited — is that correct?

Martin Johnson (Instructor): I would say that you probably don't need a domain layer. This layer is optional and only required by quite complex apps. If you have UseCase classes with only an invoke method that wouldn't count against your 10 classes but I would recommend most people to use a simpler architecture with only a UI layer and data layer. The composables and any extension functions don't count as classes.
