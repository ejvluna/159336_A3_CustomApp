## 159.336 — Assignment 3
Due: 24 October 2025

### Summary
This assignment requires you to write an Android app. You may choose any application idea (provided it is not offensive) — something
useful to you, your friends, or family is a good choice. Marks are awarded for interesting, well-written apps that make good use of
the Android platform and play nicely with other apps (for example, releasing resources when not in use).

### Key Requirements and Rules
- Your app must be written specifically for this assignment and must not have been completed for another course or before you
  started 159336. If you incorporate existing code (for example, a game written for 159261), clearly comment which parts were
  written for this assignment.
- Plagiarism is not allowed. If your app is found to be based on code from books, tutorials, or online repositories, you will
  receive 0 marks and it may be reported to the university's academic integrity office.
- You may use external libraries, but list them clearly in your comments. You may not use a complete third-party framework (for
  example, a full game engine).
- Class limit: Individual submissions — maximum 10 Kotlin classes. Group submissions — maximum 20 Kotlin classes. Apps that
  exceed these limits will receive 0 marks. This rule is intended to discourage copying apps from online sources.
    - The class limit excludes simple data classes (with no methods), theme classes, factory classes, database entities, or
      library classes provided as Gradle dependencies (i.e., not copied into the src directory).
    - If you believe you need more than the allowed classes, email the instructor to request an exemption.

### Platform and Testing
- Your application should run on the Android emulator. The instructor may also test it on a real device.
- If it is difficult to demonstrate the app on the emulator, you may submit a link to a video showing the app running.

### Submission Instructions
- Submit a single zip file generated by Android Studio via File → Export to Zip File... Do not submit an APK. If your zip does
  not build correctly, marks will be deducted. Submissions in any format other than a zip will receive 0 marks.
- For group submissions (up to 3 students): all members must submit the same zip file and include a submission comment listing the
  IDs of the other students in the group. Group submissions should represent proportionally more work and code than an individual
  submission. If you think a group member contributed less work, state this in the submission comment.

### Documentation and Comments
- Use comments in your code as documentation. If you reused code, clearly comment which portions were created specifically for
  this assignment.
- If you use external libraries, note them in comments and ensure they are added as Gradle dependencies (not copied into src).

### Ownership and Marks
- All rights to the app belong to you (or your group). You are free to publish it to the Google Play Store if you wish.
- This assignment is worth 30% of the total marks for the course.## 159.336 — Assignment 3
